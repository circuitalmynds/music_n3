The Frankie "Tram" Trumbauer Orchestra feat. Bix Beiderbecke - Singin' the Blues. The first minute of the song is a sax solo by Trumbauer. The second minute is Bix's cornet solo. The third minute features a short clarinet solo by Jimmy Dorsey, who was the clarinetist in Trumbauer's Orchestra at that time. The guitarist on this track is Eddie Lang. This song is considered a jazz classic because Bix and, to a lesser degree, Tram were able to make a slow-tempo jazz ballad swing. This ability to make slow-tempo swinging jazz would later be emulated by jazz musicians ranging from Lester Young to John Coltrane to Miles Davis.
